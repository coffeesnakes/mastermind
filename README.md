# Mastermind: break the hidden code!

Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The objective is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs (or numbers).
Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilites of the code. Can you crack the code?

Mastermind allow users to:
- Develop strategies to most efficiently decipher the code
- Submit scores to the database, comparing time and number of guesses to compete for the top 20!
- Choose game difficulty
- Check out your competition by viewing the High Scores page.
