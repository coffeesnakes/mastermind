# Mastermind: break the hidden code!

Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The objective is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs (numbers in this case).
Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilites of the code. Victory is achieved by cracking the code before 10 guesses.
