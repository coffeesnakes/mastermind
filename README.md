# mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The objective is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs (numbers in this case).
Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilites of the code. Victory is achieved by cracking the code before 10 guesses.

The game starts with the computer randomly generating a 4 digit code and then the player proceeds to try and figure out the digits and proper sequence.
